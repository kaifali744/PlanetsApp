# PlanetsApp
PlanetsApp is an Android project designed to practice the concepts of Adapters and ListView. The main screen features a ListView displaying all 8 planets of our solar system. Each list item includes an image of the planet, the planet's name, and the number of moons. When a list item is clicked, a toast message shows the planet's name.
